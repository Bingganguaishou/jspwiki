# 1. Introduction

This project builds a ready-to-use JSP Wiki distribution

* Based on Tomcat 7.0.52 as servlet engine
* Using HTTP port 9627 to avoid conflicts with existing servers running on port 80 and/or 8080

# 2. Creating The Native Launchers

The native launchers are under version control and can be re-created manually.

## 2.1 Native Windows Launcher

```
jspwiki-portable> mvn clean generate-resources

jspwiki-portable> ant woas:create-windows-app
Buildfile: /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/build.xml

woas:download-launch4j-for-mac:
    [mkdir] Created dir: /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/unpack/launch4j
      [get] Getting: http://netassist.dl.sourceforge.net/project/launch4j/launch4j-3/3.8/launch4j-3.8-macosx-x86.tgz

    [untar] Expanding: /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/unpack/launch4j/launch4j-3.8-macosx-x86.tgz into /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/unpack
   [delete] Deleting: /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/unpack/launch4j/launch4j-3.8-macosx-x86.tgz

woas:create-windows-app:
 [launch4j] Compiling resources
 [launch4j] Linking
 [launch4j] Wrapping
 [launch4j] Successfully created /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/woas/woas.exe
     [echo] Created /Users/sgoeschl/work/asf/jspwiki/trunk/jspwiki/jspwiki-portable/target/woas/woas.exe ...
```
The generated "woas.exe" can be copied manually to *jspwiki-portable/src/overlay/launchers/tomcat/woas.exe* after manual testing.

# 3. Current State

## 3.1 Mac OS X

* The Mac OS X [JarBundler](http://informagen.com/JarBundler/index.html) 2.2.0 is used to build a native Mac OS X app but it depends on having the Apple JDK installed
* Supporting a modern Oracle JDK is done using the [Oracle's AppBundler Task](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/packagingAppsForMac.html)

## 3.2 Jetty vesus Tomcat

Over the time Jetty's memory foot-print become larger and larger so I moved back to an embedded Tomcat

# 2. Available Maven Commands

```
mvn clean package
```

# 3. The Public Wiki

To secure the "public" wiki the following accounts were created

* "admin", "lEtMeIn"
* "user", "user"
